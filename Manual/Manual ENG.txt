Acess the "mapeamento" folder and use the software to map your coords.
or download it in this link:
Software:https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpos/

To config the settings.ini read the file and use the software.
DON'T FORGET TO DO SO, OR THE MACRO WON'T WORK.


Instructions for good use:
1)Don't run the bot too close for finishing a map, or in a login/error screen, the bot will bug.Run the bot on the map/initial page.

2)Change the imgs on the "Imgs" folder with your own images, it's safer that the bot will trigger.
The images need to be well cut and centralized
Ex:Take a screenshot only from the button " NEW MAP " e overwrite the original "NEWMAP.png".
don't let the screenshot take outer pixels or the bot will not trigger.
