TIP:USE RES:1920X1080 AND GX OPERA BROWSER FOR MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR YOU, THE BOT WAS WRITTEN USING OPERAGX.

Acess the "mapeamento" folder and use the software to map your coords.
or download it in this link:
Software:https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpos/

To config the settings.ini read the file and use the software.
DON'T FORGET TO DO SO, OR THE MACRO WON'T WORK.


Instructions for good use:
1)Don't run the bot too close for finishing a map, or in a login/error screen, the bot will bug.Run the bot on the map/initial page.

2)Change the imgs on the "Imgs" folder with your own images, it's safer that the bot will trigger.
The images need to be well cut and centralized
Ex:Take a screenshot only from the button " NEW MAP " e overwrite the original "NEWMAP.png".
don't let the screenshot take outer pixels or the bot will not trigger.
